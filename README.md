heisigUtils [WIP]
===========
A simple program which provides search and dependency listing for characters in Heisig's books

Installation should be as simple as running `cabal install` in this directory -- If you have any troubles with that you should file a bug and I will look into it.

If you do not yet have a haskell environment, [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/) provides a simple way to get haskell, cabal, and a few other goodies quickly set up.

A quick warning, this project is still an WIP, and nothing is set in stone. Also the provided heisig.csv is woefully lacking -- currently dependency information is only for entries up to about 300
